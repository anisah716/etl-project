# ETL project 

This project utilizes web scrapping to pull  information from a marvel fandom wiki website and  data sources to understand trends in the marvel cinematic universe. The trends are based off of ratings, budget, and box office profit. The cinematic universe is split into three phases which are analyzed into a series of trends.
